=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Command::nopaste - A clone of App::Nopaste using Mojolicious

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ mojo nopaste pastie myfile.pl
 $ cat myfile.pl | mojo nopaste shadowcat
 $ mojo nopaste -p  # contents pulled from clipboard

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a clone of the venerable L<App::Nopaste> using the L<Mojolicious> toolkit.
Nearly all of the functionality is mimicked.
Where possible the command-line system has been replicated, though the mechanism of 
choosing the service differs due to the way the L<Mojolicious::Commands> system works.

Files may be passed as arguments, read from STDIN or even read from the clipboard with the
L<Clipboard> module.
For a list of available services run C<mojo help nopaste> or C<mojo nopaste help [SERVICE]>.
